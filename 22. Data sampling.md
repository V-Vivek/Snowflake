# Data Sampling in Snowflake

Data sampling is a technique used to select a subset of data from a larger dataset. This can be useful for various purposes, such as testing, analysis, and performance optimization. Snowflake provides two primary methods for data sampling: the ROW (BERNOULLI) method and the BLOCK (SYSTEM) method.

## ROW (BERNOULLI) Method

The ROW method, also known as the BERNOULLI method, randomly selects rows from a table based on a specified percentage. Each row is considered independently, and the probability of a row being included in the sample is equal to the specified percentage.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name SAMPLE ROW(percentage);
```

## BLOCK (SYSTEM) Method

The BLOCK method, also known as the SYSTEM method, selects entire data blocks (micro-partitions) from a table. This method is generally faster than the ROW method because it operates on larger chunks of data.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name SAMPLE SYSTEM(percentage);
```

## Example Usage

### Using the ROW (BERNOULLI) Method
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees SAMPLE ROW(10);
```
This query selects approximately 10% of the rows from the `employees` table.

### Using the BLOCK (SYSTEM) Method
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees SAMPLE SYSTEM(10);
```
This query selects data from approximately 10% of the micro-partitions in the `employees` table.

## Considerations

- The ROW method provides a more uniform distribution of sampled rows but can be slower for large datasets.
- The BLOCK method is faster but may result in less uniform sampling, especially for smaller datasets.
- The actual percentage of data returned may vary slightly from the specified percentage due to the random nature of sampling.

By understanding and utilizing these sampling methods, you can efficiently work with large datasets in Snowflake for various analytical and performance optimization tasks.
