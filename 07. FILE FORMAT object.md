# File Format Object in Snowflake

## Creating a File Format

To create a file format in Snowflake, use the `CREATE FILE FORMAT` command. This command allows you to specify the format type and various options for the file format.

```sql
CREATE FILE FORMAT my_csv_format
    TYPE = 'CSV'
    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"'
    SKIP_HEADER = 1
    FIELD_DELIMITER = ',';
```

## Altering a File Format

To alter an existing file format, use the `ALTER FILE FORMAT` command. Note that you cannot change the file type property once the file format is created.

```sql
ALTER FILE FORMAT my_csv_format
    SET COMPRESSION = 'GZIP';
```

## Describing a File Format

To describe a file format and view its properties, use the `DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT` command.

```sql
DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT my_csv_format;
```

## Using a File Format

File formats are used in various Snowflake operations, such as loading data into tables using the `COPY INTO` command.

```sql
COPY INTO my_table
    FROM @my_stage/file.csv
    FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = 'my_csv_format');
```

## Example of JSON File Format

To create a JSON file format in Snowflake, use the `CREATE FILE FORMAT` command with the `TYPE` set to `JSON`.

```sql
CREATE FILE FORMAT my_json_format
    TYPE = 'JSON'
    STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY = TRUE
    IGNORE_UTF8_ERRORS = TRUE;
```

## Cannot change type
- Once created we cannot change type of a FILE FORMAT object because 2 FILE FORMAT objects have different attributes associated with it.
- For example
    - CSV has `SKIP_HEADER`, `FIELD_DELIMITER`
    - JSON has `STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY`, `IGNORE_UTF8_ERRORS`
