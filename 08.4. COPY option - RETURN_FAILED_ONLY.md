# RETURN_FAILED_ONLY

- The `RETURN_FAILED_ONLY` copy option in Snowflake is used to control the output of the `COPY INTO` command. 
- When this option is specified, only the rows that failed to load are returned in the output. 
- This can be particularly useful for debugging and error handling, as it allows you to focus on the problematic rows without being overwhelmed by the successfully loaded data. 
- It is mostly used along with `ON_ERROR=CONTINUE` to ensure that the load process continues despite encountering errors, while still capturing the failed rows for review.
- By default, the `RETURN_FAILED_ONLY` option is set to `FALSE`, which means that the `COPY INTO` command returns all rows, regardless of whether they failed or succeeded.

```sql
COPY INTO my_table
FROM @my_stage
FILES = ('file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 'file3.csv')
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV')
ON_ERROR=CONTINUE
RETURN_FAILED_ONLY = TRUE;
```
