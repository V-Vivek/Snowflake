# Stages in Snowflake

In Snowflake, a stage is a location where data files are stored (staged) before being loaded into a table. Stages can be either internal or external.

## Internal Stage

- Internal stages are storage locations within Snowflake itself. They are managed by Snowflake and provide a convenient way to stage data without needing external storage services. 
- Although Snowflake operates on cloud infrastructure provided by third-party services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, internal stages abstract away the complexity of managing this infrastructure directly.

### Example

```sql
-- Create an internal stage
CREATE STAGE my_internal_stage;

-- Upload a file to the internal stage
PUT file://path/to/your/file.csv @my_internal_stage;

-- Load data from the internal stage into a table
COPY INTO my_table
FROM @my_internal_stage/file.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV');
```

## External Stage

External stages are storage locations outside of Snowflake, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. They allow you to stage data in external storage services and then load it into Snowflake.

### Example

```sql
-- Create an external stage pointing to an S3 bucket
CREATE STAGE my_external_stage
URL = 's3://my-bucket/path/'
CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID = 'your_key_id' AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key');

-- Describe the external stage
DESC STAGE STAGE my_external_stage;

-- List files in the external stage
LIST @my_external_stage;
```
