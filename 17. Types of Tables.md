# Types of Tables in Snowflake

## Permanent Table, Permanent Schema & Permanent Database

### Permanent Table
Permanent tables are the default type of table in Snowflake. They store data until it is explicitly deleted by the user. Data in permanent tables is protected by Snowflake's fail-safe and time travel features, which allow for data recovery in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE my_permanent_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING
);
```

### Permanent Schema
A permanent schema is a logical grouping of database objects, such as tables and views, within a permanent database. Schemas help organize and manage database objects.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA my_permanent_schema;
```

### Permanent Database
A permanent database is a container for schemas, tables, and other database objects. Data stored in a permanent database is durable and protected by Snowflake's fail-safe and time travel features.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE my_permanent_database;
```

## Transient Table, Transient Schema & Transient Database

### Transient Table
Transient tables are similar to permanent tables but do not have fail-safe protection. They are designed for data that does not need the same level of durability and protection as permanent tables. Transient tables are more cost-effective for short-lived data. They support time travel, but only for a maximum of 1 day.


#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE my_transient_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING
);
```

### Transient Schema
A transient schema is a logical grouping of database objects within a permanent or  transient database. Objects in a transient schema do not have fail-safe protection, making them suitable for temporary or less critical data. We cannot create permanent tables in a transient schema.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT SCHEMA my_transient_schema;
```

### Transient Database
A transient database is a container for schemas, tables, and other database objects that do not require fail-safe protection. It is designed for temporary or less critical data that can be recreated if lost. The schema and tables within transient databse will be of transient type as well.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT DATABASE my_transient_database;
```

## Temporary Table & Temporary Schema

### Temporary Table
Temporary tables are session-specific tables that exist only for the duration of a user session. They are automatically dropped at the end of the session. Temporary tables are useful for storing intermediate results or temporary data that does not need to persist beyond the session.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE my_temporary_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING
);
```

### Temporary Schema
A temporary schema is a logical grouping of temporary tables within a session. Temporary schemas help organize and manage temporary tables, but they do not persist beyond the session.

#### Sample Code
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY SCHEMA my_temporary_schema;
```

(Note: Snowflake does not support temporary databases.)
