# Scaling Policy in Snowflake

Snowflake's scaling policy determines how the system handles the scaling of virtual warehouses, which are the compute resources in Snowflake. The scaling policy affects how quickly and efficiently Snowflake can respond to changes in workload demand.

There are two main scaling policies in Snowflake:
1. **Standard Scaling**
2. **Economy Scaling**

## Standard Scaling

- **Behavior**: Standard scaling is designed to provide the best performance by scaling up and down quickly in response to workload changes.
- **Use Case**: This policy is ideal for workloads that require consistent performance and can handle rapid changes in demand.
- **Cost**: It may incur higher costs because it prioritizes performance over cost-efficiency.

## Economy Scaling

- **Behavior**: Economy scaling is designed to minimize costs by scaling more conservatively. It may take longer to scale up or down compared to Standard scaling.
- **Use Case**: This policy is suitable for workloads where cost savings are more important than immediate performance, such as batch processing or non-time-sensitive tasks.
- **Cost**: It is generally more cost-effective because it prioritizes cost savings over immediate performance.

## Comparison

| Feature           | Standard Scaling                | Economy Scaling                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Performance**   | High                            | Moderate                        |
| **Scaling Speed** | Fast                            | Slow                            |
| **Cost**          | Higher                          | Lower                           |
| **Use Case**      | Time-sensitive, high-performance| Cost-sensitive, non-time-sensitive|

## Example Scenario

- **Standard Scaling**: A real-time analytics application that requires immediate response to user queries would benefit from Standard scaling to ensure low latency and high performance.
- **Economy Scaling**: A nightly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job that processes large amounts of data but does not require immediate results would benefit from Economy scaling to reduce costs.

## Setting and Altering the Scaling Policy

To set or alter the scaling policy for a virtual warehouse in Snowflake, you can use the `CREATE WAREHOUSE` or `ALTER WAREHOUSE` SQL commands with the `SCALING_POLICY` parameter.

### Setting the Scaling Policy

When creating a new warehouse, you can specify the scaling policy using the `SCALING_POLICY` parameter:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
    WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
    SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD'; -- or 'ECONOMY'
```

### Altering the Scaling Policy

To change the scaling policy of an existing warehouse, use the `ALTER WAREHOUSE` command:

```sql
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
    SET SCALING_POLICY = 'ECONOMY'; -- or 'STANDARD'
```

### Viewing the Current Scaling Policy

You can view the current scaling policy of a warehouse by querying the `SHOW WAREHOUSES` command:

```sql
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'my_warehouse';
```

The output will include a column named `SCALING_POLICY` that indicates the current policy.

By setting and altering the scaling policy, you can optimize the performance and cost of your Snowflake virtual warehouses according to your workload requirements.
