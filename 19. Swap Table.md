# Swap Tables in Snowflake

In Snowflake, the `SWAP` command is used to atomically swap the contents of two tables. This operation is useful for scenarios where you need to replace the contents of a table with new data without any downtime or data loss. The `SWAP` command ensures that the operation is performed in a single transaction, making it an atomic operation.

## Syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE table1 SWAP WITH table2;
```

## Example Scenario

### Use Case: Zero-Downtime Table Updates

Imagine you have a production table `current_data` that is being used by your application. You need to update this table with new data from a staging table `new_data` without causing any downtime for your application.

1. **Create a staging table**: Load the new data into a staging table.
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE new_data AS
    SELECT * FROM current_data;
    ```
2. **Transform the data**: Perform any necessary transformations on the `new_data` table before swapping.
    ```sql
    UPDATE new_data
    SET column_name = transformation_function(column_name);
    ```

3. **Swap the tables**: Use the `SWAP` command to atomically replace the contents of `current_data` with `new_data`.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE current_data SWAP WITH new_data;
    ```

4. **Verify the swap**: The `current_data` table now contains the new data, and the `new_data` table contains the old data.

This approach ensures that the update is seamless and does not affect the availability of the `current_data` table for your application.
