# Creating a Warehouse in Snowflake

- To create a warehouse in Snowflake, you can use the `CREATE WAREHOUSE` SQL command.
- Below is a sample query with commonly used parameters and their explanations:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
WITH 
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 300
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE
    COMMENT = 'This is my sample warehouse';
```

## Parameters Explained

- **WAREHOUSE_SIZE**: 
    - Defines the size of the warehouse. The size affects the number of servers allocated to the warehouse and thus its performance and cost.
    - Options include XSMALL, SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, XLARGE, XXLARGE, etc..
        - XSMALL -> 1 server
        - SMALL -> 2 servers
        - MEDIUM -> 4 servers
        - LARGE -> 8 servers
        - XLARGE -> 16 servers
        - XXLARGE -> 32 servers

- **AUTO_SUSPEND**: 
    - Specifies the number of seconds of inactivity after which the warehouse is automatically suspended to save costs. 

- **AUTO_RESUME**: 
    - If set to TRUE, the warehouse will automatically resume when a query is executed, ensuring that the warehouse is available when needed.
    - If set to FALSE, the warehouse will not automatically resume and must be manually resumed. This will impact the availability of the warehouse for query execution.

- **INITIALLY_SUSPENDED**: 
    - If set to TRUE, the warehouse will be created in a suspended state, meaning it won't consume any resources until it is explicitly resumed.

- **COMMENT**: 
    - An optional field to add a description or any notes about the warehouse.



# Alter a Warehouse in Snowflake

- To alter a warehouse in Snowflake, you can use the `ALTER WAREHOUSE` SQL command.
- Below are examples of commonly used warehouse alter commands:

```sql
-- Rename a warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
RENAME TO new_warehouse_name;

-- Change the size of a warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE';

-- Suspend a warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
SUSPEND;

-- Resume a warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
RESUME;

-- Set auto-suspend time
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 600;

-- Enable auto-resume
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
SET AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

-- Add a comment to a warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
SET COMMENT = 'Updated warehouse settings';

-- Drop a warehouse
DROP WAREHOUSE my_warehouse;
```
