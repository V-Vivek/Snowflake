## Shared Disk Architecture

In a shared disk architecture, all nodes in the system share a common disk storage. Each node has its own memory and CPU, but they all access the same disk storage. This architecture is commonly used in clustered databases.

### Drawbacks
1. **Scalability Issues**: As the number of nodes increases, the contention for the shared disk also increases, leading to performance bottlenecks.
2. **Single Point of Failure**: The shared disk can become a single point of failure. If the disk fails, the entire system can be brought down.
3. **Complexity in Coordination**: Coordinating access to the shared disk among multiple nodes can be complex and may require sophisticated locking mechanisms.

## Shared Nothing Architecture

In a shared nothing architecture, each node is independent and self-sufficient, with its own disk storage, memory, and CPU. Nodes do not share any hardware resources, and they communicate over a network.

### Drawbacks
1. **Data Distribution**: Distributing data across nodes can be challenging, especially when the data is not evenly distributed.
2. **Complexity in Query Processing**: Queries that require data from multiple nodes can be complex to process and may require significant network communication.
3. **Load Balancing**: Ensuring an even load distribution across nodes can be difficult, leading to some nodes being overburdened while others are underutilized.

## Snowflake Architecture

Snowflake architecture is a modern data warehousing architecture that overcomes the drawbacks of both shared disk and shared nothing architectures. It uses a combination of cloud storage and compute resources to provide a scalable and resilient solution.

Snowflake’s unique architecture consists of three key layers:

1. **Database Storage**: Snowflake uses a central storage layer that is fully managed and optimized for high performance. Data is stored in a compressed, columnar format and can be accessed by multiple compute nodes simultaneously.

2. **Query Processing(Muscle of Snowflake)**: This layer consists of multiple compute nodes, called virtual warehouses, that execute queries. Each virtual warehouse is independent and can be scaled up or down based on the workload.

3. **Cloud Services(Brain of Snowflake)**: This layer provides various services such as authentication, metadata management, query optimization, and access control. It coordinates the activities of the storage and compute layers and ensures efficient and secure data processing.

### How It Overcomes Drawbacks
1. **Scalability**: Snowflake separates storage and compute resources, allowing each to scale independently. This means you can scale up compute resources without affecting storage and vice versa.
2. **Resilience**: By leveraging cloud storage, Snowflake ensures high availability and durability of data. The architecture is designed to handle hardware failures gracefully.
3. **Simplified Data Management**: Snowflake automatically manages data distribution and optimization, reducing the complexity of data distribution and query processing.
4. **Performance**: Snowflake's architecture allows for efficient query processing by using a combination of caching, optimization, and parallel processing techniques.
