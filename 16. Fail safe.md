# Fail Safe Feature in Snowflake

## Overview
The Fail Safe feature in Snowflake is designed to protect your data from accidental loss or corruption. It provides an additional layer of data protection by retaining dropped or deleted data for a specified period, allowing for recovery in case of emergencies.

## Data Retention Period
The data retention period for Fail Safe is 7 days. This period starts immediately after the Time Travel retention period ends. During this time, Snowflake retains the data in a non-accessible state, ensuring that it can be recovered if necessary.

## Data Recovery
Only Snowflake can recover data from Fail Safe. If you need to recover data that has entered the Fail Safe period, you must contact Snowflake Support. They will assist you in the recovery process.
