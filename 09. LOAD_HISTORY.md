# LOAD_HISTORY

## COPY_DB.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LOAD_HISTORY
The `COPY_DB.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LOAD_HISTORY` view provides metadata about data loading operations that have occurred within a specific database. This view includes details such as the file names, load times, row counts, and any errors encountered during the load process. It is useful for monitoring and auditing data loads at the database level.

### Columns:
- `FILE_NAME`: The name of the file that was loaded.
- `LOAD_TIME`: The timestamp when the load operation occurred.
- `ROW_COUNT`: The number of rows loaded.
- `ERROR_COUNT`: The number of errors encountered during the load.

## SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOAD_HISTORY
The `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOAD_HISTORY` view provides a broader scope of metadata about data loading operations across the entire Snowflake account. This view includes similar details as the database-specific view but aggregates data from all databases within the account. It is useful for account-wide monitoring and auditing of data loads.

### Columns:
- `FILE_NAME`: The name of the file that was loaded.
- `LOAD_TIME`: The timestamp when the load operation occurred.
- `ROW_COUNT`: The number of rows loaded.
- `ERROR_COUNT`: The number of errors encountered during the load.
- `DATABASE_NAME`: The name of the database where the load occurred.
- `SCHEMA_NAME`: The name of the schema where the load occurred.

## Differences
- **Scope**: `COPY_DB.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LOAD_HISTORY` is limited to a specific database, while `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOAD_HISTORY` covers the entire account.
- **Columns**: The account-level view includes additional columns such as `DATABASE_NAME` and `SCHEMA_NAME` to provide context for where the load operations occurred.
- **Use Case**: Use the database-specific view for detailed monitoring within a single database and the account-level view for a comprehensive overview of data loading activities across all databases in the account.
