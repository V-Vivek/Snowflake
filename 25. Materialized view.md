# Materialized Views in Snowflake

## Overview
Materialized views in Snowflake are database objects that store the result of a query physically. They are designed to improve query performance by precomputing and storing the results of complex queries.

## Syntax to Create a Materialized View
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_materialized_view AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM my_table
WHERE condition;
```

## Comparison: Materialized View vs. Standard View

| Feature                | Materialized View                          | Standard View                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Storage Cost           | Higher (stores physical data)              | Lower (no physical storage)               |
| Compute Cost           | Higher (due to maintenance and refresh)    | Lower (computed on-the-fly)               |
| Performance            | Faster query performance                   | Slower query performance                  |
| Maintenance            | Requires periodic refresh                  | No maintenance required                   |


## Limitations of Materialized Views
Materialized views in Snowflake have several limitations:
- Cannot use joins
- Cannot use user-defined functions (UDFs)
- Cannot use `HAVING` clause
- Cannot use `ORDER BY` clause
- Cannot use `LIMIT` clause

## Use Cases
### Standard View
- When you need the most up-to-date data
- When the query is simple and does not require significant computation
- When storage cost is a concern

### Materialized View
- When you need faster query performance for complex queries
- When the data does not change frequently, reducing the need for frequent refreshes
- When you can afford the additional storage and compute costs for improved performance
