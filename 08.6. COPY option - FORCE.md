# FORCE Option in Snowflake

The `FORCE` option in Snowflake is used with the `COPY INTO` command to force the loading of files, even if they have already been loaded. 

## Usage

When the `FORCE` option is set to `TRUE`, Snowflake will load the files regardless of whether they have been previously loaded. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to reload data for some reason.

```sql
COPY INTO my_table
FROM @my_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (FORMAT_NAME = my_format)
FORCE = TRUE;
```

## Important Consideration

Setting the `FORCE` option to `TRUE` can lead to duplicate data being loaded into your table. This is because Snowflake does not check whether the files have already been processed.

To avoid duplicates, ensure that you handle the deduplication logic in your data processing pipeline or use other mechanisms to track loaded files.
